## 🎯 About CDIWG
The **Civic Digital Initiative Working Group (CDIWG)** is a multidisciplinary "Do-Tank" of developers, policy architects, and community anchors. We are dedicated to building digital public infrastructure that strengthens transparency and inclusion.

Our current flagship project, **[Bouskoura.online](https://bouskoura.online)**, serves as an independent Alpha platform demonstrating how local digital governance can improve quality of life. We operate under the strategic principle: **Build First, Partner Second.**

## ⚖️ Our Charter of Values
We believe technology must be a servant of the people. Our work is governed by four non-negotiable pillars:

1. **Digital Inclusion**: Simple, accessible services for every citizen, regardless of tech-literacy.
2. **Data Sovereignty**: Community data belongs to the public. We ensure transparency and portability.
3. **Civic Neutrality**: Strictly non-partisan and commercially neutral. We serve only the general interest.
4. **Data Protection**: **We will never sell, rent, or monetize citizen data. Ever.**
